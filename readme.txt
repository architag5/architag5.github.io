--Readme document for *Archita Ganesh*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

Explanation for validation:
- For the W3C validation checker, I had CSS errors and warnings from Bootstrap and not my own styling sheet(My *global-style.css* was validated!). 
Just wanted to point that out, since I can't correct the Bootstrap errors and warnings.
- For the AChecker: I listed the reasons as to why I didn't fix the potential problems
    - Index page: Many of the potential problems were talking about the comments I used to cite my sources,
the formatting of the Bootstrap stylesheet, and the scripts. 
    - About Me page: Most of the potential problems were talking about the color of my image, a longer alt(even though the guidelines say it shouldn't be lengthy),
    my comments I used to cite sources, and the navbar's linking and bootstrap sources.
    - Resume page: Most of the potential problems were linked to the Source comments. 
    - Contact page: Most of the potential problems were addressing the Source comment citations and
    how the nav bar from bootstrap doesn't have meaningful text.
