        Hi! Welcome to my personal Portfolio! My name is Archita Ganesh
        and I attend University of California, Irvine. 
        
        I am studying Informatics, with a specialization in Organizational Information Technology(OIT). 
        I enjoy the intersection of business and technology and hope to find a career in that sector. 
        I enjoy meeting new people, learning new ways of thinking, and help find impactful ways that we could integrate technology in out lives.
        I am also truly passionate about empowering women in tech, as shown in my work as EVP for Women in Information and Computer Sciences(WICS) at UCI.
        I believe that when technology is used the right way, it can empower numerous people around the world. 

        I hope to keep on learning and growing!
