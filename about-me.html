          My name is Archita Ganesh
          and I attend University of California, Irvine.        
          I am studying Informatics, with a specialization in Organizational Information Technology(OIT).
          I enjoy the intersection of business   <i class="material-icons">business</i> and technology <i class="material-icons">laptop</i> and hope to find a career in that sector. I am also very passionate about the healthcare space.<br> <br>
  
          
          I enjoy meeting new people, learning new ways of thinking, and finding impactful ways that we could integrate technology in out lives.
          I am also truly passionate about empowering women and underrepresented minorities in tech, as shown in my work as EVP for Women in Information and Computer Sciences(WICS) at UCI 
          and as a mentor in AppJam+. <br> <br>
  
  
          I hope to keep on learning and growing within tech and beyond! <br> <br>
