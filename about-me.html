        Hi! Welcome to my personal portfolio! <br> <br>
        
        My name is Archita Ganesh
        and I attend University of California, Irvine.        
        I am studying Informatics, with a specialization in Organizational Information Technology(OIT).
        I enjoy the intersection of business   <i class="material-icons">business</i> and technology <i class="material-icons">laptop</i> and hope to find a career in that sector. I am also very passionate about the healthcare space.<br> <br>

        
        I enjoy meeting new people, learning new ways of thinking, and finding impactful ways that we could integrate technology in out lives.
        I am also truly passionate about empowering women and underrepresented minorities in tech, as shown in my work as EVP for Women in Information and Computer Sciences(WICS) at UCI 
        and as a mentor in AppJam+. <br> <br>


        I hope to keep on learning and growing within tech and beyond! <br> <br>
